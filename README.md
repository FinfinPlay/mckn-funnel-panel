## What are funnel charts?

A funnel chart is a specialized chart type that demonstrates the flow of e.g. users through a business or sales process. The chart takes its name from its shape, which starts from a broad head and ends in a narrow neck. The number of users at each stage of the process are indicated from the funnelâ€™s width as it narrows.

## Getting Started
